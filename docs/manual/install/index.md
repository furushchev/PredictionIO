# Installing PredictionIO

To get started, install PredictionIO Server and choose a SDK for your
application.

## Prerequisites

It is **very important** to meet the minimum version of the following
technologies that power PredictionIO.

* Apache Hadoop 2.4.0 (required only if YARN and HDFS are needed)
* Apache HBase 0.98.6
* Apache Spark 1.1.0 for Hadoop 2.4
* Elasticsearch 1.3.0
* Java 7

> **Notes for Linux Users**

> If you are using Linux, Apache Spark local mode, which is the default
operation mode without further configuration, may not work. In that case,
configure your Apache Spark to run in [standalone cluster
mode](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html).

## Installing PredictionIO Server

PredictionIO runs on a Java virtual machine, so it runs on most platforms.
